## 🧠 Working Principle

1. The soil moisture sensor measures the soil’s humidity level.  
2. When the moisture drops below a threshold, the Arduino triggers a relay module.  
3. The relay powers a water pump that irrigates the plants automatically.  
4. Once the soil reaches the desired moisture level, the system turns the pump off.  

This ensures **efficient water use** and eliminates the need for manual watering.
